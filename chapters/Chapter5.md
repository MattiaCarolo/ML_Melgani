## Main Squared Error (MSE)

Resort to loss minimaztion

$$ E(\bold{w}, D) $$

## SUpport Vector Machine

Linear classifier which maximizes the separation margin between the two classes. The solution depends on a small subset of training example where the idea is the result of the training depends on few critical examples.
The generalization error is strictly correlated to the margin.
A perk of SVM is that it can be estended to nonlinear separation (*kernel machines*)
